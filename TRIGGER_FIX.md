# Fixed: False Positive Trigger Detection

## Problem
The system was clicking "not interested" on ALL videos because OpenAI was detecting triggers too broadly. For example, with trigger "valorant", it would detect ANY gaming content as "related to valorant".

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stricter Trigger Detection Prompt (video_analyzer.py)

**Before:** Detected "Any symbols or imagery related to the triggers"

**After:** Only detects if trigger is EXPLICITLY present:
- The exact word must be visible in text/captions
- The logo/brand must be clearly shown
- The actual thing itself must be present

### 2. Higher Confidence Threshold
- Changed from 0.7 to 0.85
- Added "Be VERY conservative - when in doubt, set trigger_detected to false"

### 3. Clear Examples in Prompt
```
- Trigger "valorant": ONLY detect if you see the word "Valorant", Valorant logo, or actual Valorant gameplay
- NOT other FPS games or gaming content in general
```

### 4. Reset Timer After Trigger
- When "not interested" is clicked, reset video timer
- Prevents trying to navigate again after handling trigger

## Correct Workflow Now

### Normal Video (No Trigger):
1. Video plays
2. After 15 seconds → Press Down Arrow to skip
3. Next video starts

### Video With Trigger (e.g., "valorant"):
1. Video plays
2. If "Valorant" explicitly shown/mentioned → Click "Not interested"
3. Next video starts automatically

## Testing

1. **Set trigger:** Add "valorant" in extension
2. **Watch TikTok:** Most videos should play for 15s then skip
3. **Trigger test:** Only videos that EXPLICITLY show Valorant should trigger

## Performance

- **Frame rate:** 2 FPS (checks twice per second)
- **Response time:** 0.5-1 second to detect trigger
- **Skip time:** 15 seconds for non-trigger videos
- **Click delay:** 50ms for fast clicking

## Common False Positives (Now Fixed)

With trigger "valorant", these should NO LONGER trigger:
- ❌ Other FPS games (CS:GO, Overwatch, etc.)
- ❌ General gaming content
- ❌ Esports content without Valorant
- ❌ Similar looking games

Only triggers when:
- ✅ "Valorant" text visible
- ✅ Valorant logo shown
- ✅ Actual Valorant gameplay
- ✅ Someone saying "Valorant"
